Great. I’ll look into how to implement a candlestick chart in a Flutter app using `syncfusion_flutter_charts`, with features similar to OKX and Bitget Wallet. This will include zooming, panning, interactive tooltips, and how to structure the chart with your data format.

I'll update you shortly with best practices, sample code, and configuration tips.
